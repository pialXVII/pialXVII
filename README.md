## 👋 About Me  
I’m a computer science student on a mission to build real-world systems + interactive visual apps.  
- Passionate about **computer graphics**, working with tools like PyOpenGL and implementing custom algorithms (line-drawing, transformations).  
- Designing **embedded/IoT systems** — projects using microcontrollers (Arduino, Raspberry Pi), sensors, actuators, cameras.  
- Striving to create *autonomous robots* and smart systems (not just line-followers or remote-controlled) that perceive, decide & act.  
- I follow structured code templates (as required in my CSE423 class and other courses) to ensure clarity, maintainability & discipline.

## 🧰 Tech Stack  
**Languages & Tools:**  
- Python (including NumPy, PyOpenGL)  
- C / C++ (microcontroller work)  
- Arduino / ESP32 / Raspberry Pi  
- Embedded firmware, sensor integration, actuator control  
- 3D graphics fundamentals: vector math, modelling, shading  
- Version control (Git & GitHub)

## 🗂 Featured Projects  
Here are some highlighted repositories:  
- **CSE423-ComputerGraphics** — My coursework for the CSE423 class: modelling transformations, vector/line drawing, interactive graphics.  
- **DIY-Smart-Street-Light** — An embedded system with LDR, IR sensors, ultrasonic sensor, servo + DC motor to create an autonomous smart street light.  
- **Smart Delivery Receive Box** — Using ESP32-CAM & Arduino Uno: automatic parcel detection, image capture, secure box opening.  
- **Catch-the-Diamonds!** — My PyOpenGL game: uses only `GL_POINTS`, custom midpoint line algorithm, bounding-box collision, UI (pause/restart/exit), 500×500 window.  
- *(Add other repos as you like, e.g., robotics platform, sensor networks, etc.)*
