👋 Hi, I’m pialXVII

“The only easy day was yesterday.”

🎯 About Me

I’m a computer science student passionate about computer graphics, embedded systems, and autonomous robotics.

Currently sharpening my skills in Python and working with tools like PyOpenGL for graphics, as well as microcontrollers like Arduino and Raspberry Pi for real-world hardware projects.

I’m always looking to collaborate on projects that solve real-world problems and push my boundaries in algorithm design, system integration, and creative engineering.

🔧 What I Work On

Here are some of the key project themes I’m engaged with:

Computer Graphics: Implementing custom line-drawing algorithms, interactive graphics using PyOpenGL, and working through modelling and vector transformations.

Embedded/IoT Projects: Designing systems like smart devices (e.g., autonomous street lights, delivery-box automation) that use a mix of sensors, actuators, and controllers.

Autonomous Robotics: Creating robots that can sense, decide, and act — using multiple sensors and actuators — aiming to move beyond simple remote control or line-following.

Python Programming: Developing clean, structured code following lab/class templates, ensuring maintainable logic and code-readability — especially for graphics and hardware interfacing.

🗂 Notable Repositories

Computer-Graphics – My work with OpenGL: custom algorithms, graphics rendering, interactive applications.

Emotional_damage- – A Python project exploring algorithmic logic (fun name, serious learning).

CSE110-CSE111-OOP-CSE220-CSE221 – A collection of coursework notebooks covering foundational CS topics (object-oriented programming, data structures).

CSE321-BRACU – Advanced coursework repository showing my deepening in computer science.
