## 👋 About Me
I build robots, embedded systems, and web software that solve real problems.  
I enjoy full-stack development from hardware (sensors, microcontrollers) to server-side (Laravel/PHP) and data work (Python — ML & NLP).  
I document my projects here on GitHub so others can learn, reuse, and collaborate.

## 🧭 What I Do
- Design and build **robotics & embedded systems** (ESP32, Arduino, Raspberry Pi) for home automation and security.  
- Develop **web and software applications** using **Laravel / PHP** with SQL databases.  
- Create **computer graphics** projects using **Python + OpenGL**.  
- Learn and apply **NLP (NLTK)** and **machine learning** (Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib).  
- Currently planning to expand into **cybersecurity**.

## 🗂 Featured Projects
- **Home Security & Automation System** — A complete robotics/embedded project using sensors, actuators, camera and automation control.   
- **DIY Smart Street Light** — Autonomous street light using LDR, IR & ultrasonic sensors with servo and DC motor control.  
- **Catch-the-Diamonds!** — A PyOpenGL interactive game using GL_POINTS, custom midpoint line algorithm, collision detection & UI controls.  
- **Emotional Damage (Game)** — A Python & OpenGL comedy-themed graphics game demonstrating custom rendering and event interaction.  
- **Web Application (Laravel & PHP)** — SQL-based full-stack system with authentication, CRUD dashboard, and structured MVC design.  
- **Organic Food Seller Website** — A webpage for showcasing and selling organic food products online.
